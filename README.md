## 🎶 How to Add Songs  

1. Open the **Add Song** section in the app.  
2. Fill in the details:  
   - 🎵 Song Name  
   - 👤 Artist Name  
   - 📁 Song File Path (`.mp3` local or online)  
   - 🖼️ Image URL (optional)  
3. Click **Add Song** — it appears instantly and is saved to **Local Storage**.  
4. Use **Reset Playlist** to restore default songs.  

You can use:  
- **Local files** from this repo (e.g., `No lie.mp3`, `No lie.jpg`)  
- **Online links** that directly end with `.mp3` or `.jpg`  

> ⚠️ YouTube or Spotify links **won’t work** — they aren’t direct audio sources.

## 💾 Local Storage Explained  

- Added songs are **stored permanently** in your browser.  
- Data **stays saved** after refreshing or closing the page.  
- **Reset Playlist** clears all added songs and reloads defaults.  

---

## 🧠 How It Works  

1. Loads a default song list on page load.  
2. Plays songs using HTML5 `<audio>` features.  
3. JavaScript handles play/pause, next/previous, and progress updates.  
4. Search filters songs in real time.  
5. Added or liked songs are saved via **Local Storage**.

## 🧩 Example  

Adding **“No Lie”** by **Sean Paul ft. Dua Lipa** with: 
 
-Song: No Lie
-Artist: Sean Paul ft. Dua Lipa
-File: No lie.mp3
-Image: No lie.jpg

➡️ The song appears in the playlist, plays instantly when selected, and stays saved permanently in Local Storage — even after closing or refreshing the page.
