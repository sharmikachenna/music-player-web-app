## 🎶 How to Add Songs  

Since this is a **GitHub project**, users must **have the song files on their computer** to add them.  


**Important:** Only **.mp3 files** or **direct online `.mp3` links** work.  
- You **cannot use YouTube, Spotify, or other streaming websites** because the browser cannot extract audio from those sites.  


---

### 1️⃣ Using Songs Already in the Repo

1. Open the **Add Song** section in the app.  
2. Fill in the details:

| Field | Example |
|-------|---------|
| Song Name | No Lie |
| Artist | Sean Paul ft. Dua Lipa |
| File Path | `No lie.mp3` |
| Image URL | `No lie.jpg`  |

3. Click **Add Song** → Song appears in the playlist and is saved in Local Storage.  

---

### 2️⃣ Adding Your Own Songs

1. **Download the repo** to your computer.  
2. Put your `.mp3` files and  `.jpg` images in the **same folder as the app**.  
3. Open the app (`index.html`) in a browser.  
4. Go to **Add Song** and fill in:

| Field | Example |
|-------|---------|
| Song Name | MySong |
| Artist | MyArtist |
| File Path | `MySong.mp3` |
| Image URL | `MySong.jpg` (optional) |

5. Click **Add Song** → Song appears in the playlist and is saved in Local Storage.  

---

### ✅ Tips

- File names **must match exactly** (including spaces and capitalization).  
- Only `.mp3` files are supported.  
- Images are optional but recommended.  
- Songs stay in Local Storage after refreshing or closing the browser.  

---

## 💾 Local Storage Explained  

- Added songs are **stored permanently** in your browser.  
- Data **stays saved** after refreshing or closing the page.  
- **Reset Playlist** clears all added songs and restores defaults.  

---

## 🧠 How It Works  

1. Loads a default song list on page load.  
2. Plays songs using HTML5 `<audio>` features.  
3. JavaScript handles play/pause, next/previous, and progress updates.  
4. Search filters songs in real time.  
5. Added or liked songs are saved via **Local Storage**.
